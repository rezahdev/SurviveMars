## Unity 3D Game - SurviveMars
SurviveMars is a 3D desktop-compatible FPS survival type game built on Unity with C#. I developed this game on top of a guided project to revisit the Unity game engine functionalities. The game attempts to create a Mars-like environment while challenging the player to survive from Alien/Zombie attack. :video_game:
