## Welcome to SurviveMars
SurviveMars in a FPS survival type built on unity with C#. This is a fun little game that I developed on top of a guided project to revisit the Unity game engine functionalities. The game attempts to create a Mars-like environment while challenging the player to survive from Aliens/Zombies. :joy:

## License
It does not have any License but contains some free third-party assets and some code snippets that you can check in the credit.txt file.

## How to Play
Clone, build, and try surviving in Mars.

## Future Improvement
 - Ammunation limit should be specified for each weapon. 
 - Some kind of stamina booster or food hidden throughout the map to be collected for points, stamina, or survival.
