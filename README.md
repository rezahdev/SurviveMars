## Welcome to SurviveMars
SurviveMars is a 3D desktop compatible FPS survival type game built on Unity with C#. I developed this game on top of a guided project to revisit the Unity game engine functionalities. The game attempts to create a Mars-like environment while challenging the player to survive from Alien/Zombie attack. :video_game:

## License
No license but it contains some free third-party assets and might have some unchanged code from various tutorials that you can check in the Credits.txt file for reference.

## How to Play
You can clone and try the project.

## Future Improvement
 - Ammo limit should be specified for each weapon. 
 - Some kind of stamina booster or food hidden throughout the map to be collected for points, stamina, or survival.
